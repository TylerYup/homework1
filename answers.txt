What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

While merging and rebasing both combine the changes from two branches together. They do it very differently. Merging takes two branches and creates a merge commit which combines all the commits on the feature branch into a single commit on the main branch. This preserves the history of both branches and creates a branch like structure for the history. On the other hand, rebasing effectively moves the feature branch so that it starts at the end of the main branch (connecting the two together linearly). This creates a linear structure and results in the project history being rewritten as for each commit in the main branch a new commit is added to the new combined branch.
